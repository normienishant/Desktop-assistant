Please check my code if you think that it can be imporved please suggest.

***IT WILL ONLY WORK ON WINDOWS***
*FOR MAC AND LINUX*
You need to change the code a little bit by just remove pyttsx3 module and its related command.
As mac and linux or you can say unix systems are inbuit python modules to run the audio format unlike windows that require a module to run speak command.
